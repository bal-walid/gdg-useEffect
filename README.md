# Pre-workshop setup:
## 1. Install Node.js if you haven't already

1. Install Node.js by clicking the download button on the [official Node website](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Run .msi installer and follow steps, make sure to check "Add to PATH"
3. Run the following commands to verify the installation. If they output a version number, the installation was successful.

   - **Node:**
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```

   - **npm:**
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```
## 2. Setup a local clone of this repo
To code along during the workshop, you'll want to do the following:

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bal-walid/gdg-useEffect
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd gdg-useEffect
```
3. Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Test the project:

```
If you see a localhost link in your terminal then everything is ready. See you tomorrow!
